Getting started with Terraform 
==============================

We will deploy an EC2 (Ubuntu18.04) via terraform and we connect to the machine via SSH.

Step 1:
-------
Install terraform binary [here](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html)

```shell script
cd terraform # Go to terraform directory
terraform init # Get aws plugins
mv terraform.tfvars.example terraform.tfvars # Rename terraform.tfvars
```

Go to edit the terraform.tfvars, you need to pass the Private/Public ssh path.


If you don't have ssh keys on your computer generate one with :
````shell script
ssh-keygen 
````
Accept all default values for ssh-keygen

Put the correct permission on your private key:

````shell script
chmod 600 <PRIVATE_KEY>
````

Then edit your tfvars variables with ssh key/name:  

````hcl-terraform
aws_public_key_ssh_path = "<MY_PATH>/<MY_PUBLIC_KEY>.pub"
aws_private_key_ssh_path = "<MY_PATH>/<MY_PRIVATE_KEY>"
````


Step 2:
-------

To allow authentification to aws api, you need to export your credentials.
you can use the aws cli:
````
aws configure 
````

And enter your access_key_id and your secret

```shell script
cd terraform # Go to terraform directory
terraform init # Get aws plugins
terraform plan # To get a dry run
terraform apply # Apply creation of the infra
```

Step 3:
-------

Test ssh connection, go to terraform.tfstate and get the value of the key : ssh_connect_cli.

This is the command line to connect to your machine:
 
````shell script
ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa_aws ubuntu@ec2-xx-xx-xx-xx.eu-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com'
````

Example:

````json
{
  "version": 4,
  "terraform_version": "0.12.9",
  "serial": 5,
  "outputs": {
    "ssh_connect_cli": {
      "value": "ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa_aws ubuntu@ec2-xx-xx-xx-xx.eu-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com",
      "type": "string"
    }
  }
}
````
